# Getting Started

## Demo (in 5 minutes)

**Note**: This will be added soon.

## Project structure

Before proceeding, ensure that Zap.ts is installed by following the instructions on the [installation](/docs/introduction/installation) page and make sure to read our [best practices](/docs/misc/best-practices) to learn more about Zap.ts' philosophy.

Since Zap.ts is _simply_ a **Next.js starter kit**, you own your code; therefore can keep what you like and get rid of things you don't need. To learn more, read the [architecture](/docs/introduction/architecture) page.

### The `src/` Directory

Zap.ts follows a classic **Next.js** app structure with a `src/` directory. Learn more about the decisions and philosophy in the [best practices](/docs/misc/best-practices) guide.

<Files>
    <File name="package.json" />
    <File name="tsconfig.json" />
    <File name="zap.config.ts" />
    <File name="next.config.ts" />
    <File name="drizzle.config.dev.ts" />
    <File name="drizzle.config.prod.ts" />
    <File name=".env" />
    <Folder name="src">
      <Folder name="app" />
      <Folder name="components" />
      <Folder name="hooks" />
      <Folder name="lib" />
      <Folder name="providers" />
      <Folder name="rpc" />
      {/* Other src folders */}
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="zap">
      <Folder name="ai" />
      <Folder name="analytics" />
      <Folder name="auth" />
      <Folder name="db" />
      <Folder name="mails" />
      <Folder name="payments" />
      {/* Other plugin folders */}
    </Folder>
</Files>

### Folder Structure

  - `src/`: Source code for your Next.js app.
    - `app/`: Application routes and pages.
    - `components/`: Reusable UI components.
    - `hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
    - `lib/`: Utility functions and libraries.
    - `providers/`: Context and theme providers.
    - `rpc/`: Remote procedure call definitions.
  - `zap/`: Modular plugins for features like analytics, auth, payments, etc.
  - `zap.config.ts`: Central configuration for your app (name, plugins, SEO, etc.).
  - `next.config.ts`: Next.js configuration.
  - `drizzle.config.*.ts`: Database configuration for Drizzle ORM.
  - `.env`: Environment variables for connecting to services.

Each folder and file is designed to keep your project organized, scalable, and easy to maintain. You can add, remove, or customize any part to fit your needs. For more details, see the documentation for each plugin and configuration file.

## Environment variables

The `.env` file connects your app to services like the database or email provider. You can remove the ones you don't need.

Update it with your own settings. Below is an example.

```dotenv
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_better_auth_secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
DATABASE_URL_DEV=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/zap_dev
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_polar_access_token
POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_polar_webhook_secret
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

If you need to generate a new `.env` file, you can use the following command using the CLI:

```bash
zap generate env
```

Also, don't forget to configure your environment variables in your Zap.ts deployment environment.

<Callout type="warn">
The above `.env` file serves as an example. You should only rely on the instance of Zap.ts that was present during its initial installation.
</Callout>

## Configure the app

Your main configuration file is `zap.config.ts`, located in the root of your project. This file controls the core settings for your Zap.ts app and is designed to be clear, modular, and easy to maintain.

Here’s what you can configure:

- **App Information**: Set your app’s name, description, base URL, and contact emails. These values are used throughout your app and for SEO/meta tags.
- **Plugin Management**: Enable or disable built-in plugins like auth, analytics, payments, blog, AI, and more. Each plugin can be toggled on or off to keep your app lean and focused.
- **Security Settings**: Define [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) and [Permissions Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy) for your app. This helps you control what resources can be loaded and what browser features are allowed, improving security and privacy.
- **Default Metadata**: Set up [SEO](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/SEO) and [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) metadata, including title, description, keywords, author, publisher, and social sharing images. These settings help your app look great in search results and when shared on social media.

You can customize any of these settings to fit your needs. The config file is fully typed and documented, so you’ll get autocompletion and validation in your editor.

Each plugin also has its own configuration file (usually `zap.plugin.config.ts`). For details, see the [Plugins Overview](/docs/plugins/overview).
