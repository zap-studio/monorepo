# What's Zap.ts?

**Zap.ts** – with the ⚡️ symbol – is a **Next.js** boilerplate designed to help you build applications _faster_ using a modern set of tools. It also comes with best practices to build _excellent_ modern web applications.

It's _fast_ to set up and very _easy_ to use. It comes with clear documentation and a carefully selected set of tools that make the developer experience (DX) modern and enjoyable.

## Why it exists?

Starting a new web project always means repeating the _same_ steps:

- installing tools such as linters
- setting up a database
- adding login features
- creating email systems
- handling payments
- and more...

A ready-made solution saves time and lets the focus stay on making something useful, not on these boring setup tasks, right?

It gives one easy way to do things, a _framework_, improving the developer experience (DX). This means no need to worry about how it all works inside—just use it, it's _**reliable**_ and _**simple**_.

And, if you want to dive deeper, the code is open for you to explore and modify in an easy way.

## Who is it for?

_Zap.ts is designed for startups and solo developers who move fast and demand simplicity._

Startups need tools that keep pace with rapid iteration and scaling. Solo developers want solutions that are straightforward, fast to set up, and don't get in the way.

Built with this in mind, Zap.ts acts as a launchpad to turn your idea into a working product faster than ever.

Here's why it's a game-changer for your team:

- **Cost-Effective**: No need to reinvent the wheel or hire specialists because Zap.ts gives you a production-ready stack for free.
- **Future-Proof**: With flexible tools, you can adapt to new requirements or tech trends without a full rewrite.
- **Scalability**: From prototype to scale, the modern libraries ensure your app grows without breaking.
- **Speed to Market**: Pre-configured tools and seamless integrations mean you skip the setup grind and start building your MVP right away.
- **Vendor Lock-In Avoidance**: We prioritize agnostic, open tools that keep your stack flexible so you're never tied to a single provider or ecosystem.

Whether you're a solo founder or a small team, Zap.ts empowers you to ship fast, iterate often, and compete with the big players.

## Credits

Zap.ts wouldn't exist without those _wonderful_ tools:

- [AI Vercel SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/): A toolkit for streaming text, handling objects, using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and more. It lets you switch between providers without depending on a specific SDK.
- [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com/): A simple and flexible way to set up authentication. It works with any framework, avoids vendor lock-in, and connects seamlessly to your database.
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/): An ORM that lets you write database schemas in TypeScript, sync them with your database, and is easy to use.
- [Flags SDK](https://flags-sdk.dev/): A free SDK to use feature flags that works with any provider.
- [nuqs](https://nuqs.vercel.app/): A library for managing URL state in Next.js applications with type safety and automatic serialization.
- [oRPC](https://orpc.unnoq.com/): An alternative to [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) that supports OpenAPI specs, making it easy to build type-safe APIs for frontend and backend.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/): The best way to get ready-to-use UI components that you can customize however you like.
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/): A lightweight alternative to Redux and React Context. It helps you write less code, do more, and supports local storage persistence out of the box.
- And more...
