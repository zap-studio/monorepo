# Overview

Zap.ts architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. It leverages the power of TypeScript and modern web development practices to provide a robust foundation for building applications.

Since Zap.ts is built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), it inherits all the features and benefits of the Next.js framework while introducing its own conventions and best practices.

Below, we will compare the architecture of a Zap.ts application with that of a traditional Next.js application.

## Dependency Overview

Zap.ts builds on top of Next.js, extending its classic dependencies and adding many more for enhanced features, developer experience, and scalability.

Zap.ts also includes many dev tools and scripts for database management, email previews, code analysis, and more, making it a full-featured boilerplate for modern web apps.

## Files & Folders

Also, we keep track of files and folders that are specific to Zap.ts, compared to a traditional Next.js app.
