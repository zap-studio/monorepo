# Overview

Zap.ts comes with a curated set of plugins to help you build modern web applications faster and with best practices out of the box. Here’s a quick overview of what’s included.

### The `zap/` Directory

Zap.ts gives you additional plugins that follows a modular approach, since each plugin is encapsulated in its own directory under `zap/`.

<Files>
    <Folder name="zap">
        <Folder name="analytics" />
        <Folder name="auth" />
        <Folder name="db" />
        <Folder name="components" />
        <Folder name="mails" />
        <Folder name="payments" />
    </Folder>
</Files>
