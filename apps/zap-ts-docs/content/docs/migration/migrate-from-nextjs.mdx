# Migrating from Next.js to Zap.ts

Zap.ts builds on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), providing a starter kit with additional plugins and features for modern web apps.

## Migration Steps

If you already have a Next.js project, you don&apos;t need to create a new app from scratch. You can run `create-zap-app migrate` in your existing Next.js project to migrate it to Zap.ts.

The `create-zap-app` CLI will follow these steps to migrate your project to Zap.ts:

1. Fetches Zap.ts template from GitHub and extracts it.
2. Add additional Zap.ts specific configurations and files. If conflicts arise, you will be prompted to resolve them.
3. Reworks `package.json` to include only necessary dependencies from your selected plugins.
4. Remove unused plugins specific folder and files.
5. Installs new dependencies using your current package manager by detecting your lock file.
6. Remove IDE-specific folder according to the selected IDE.
7. Creates or appends `.env.local` file with placeholders (e.g. `DATABASE_URL`, `API_KEY`).
8. Launch `<pm> run format` to format the codebase (if applicable).

You can use the CLI with arguments to help automate parts of the migration. Available options:

- `--plugins <plugins>`: Specify the plugins to install (e.g. waitlist, feedbacks).
- `--ide <ide>`: Specify the IDE to use (vscode, windsurf, zed, cursor).
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging for detailed output during the migration process.

Example usage:

```
create-zap-app --plugins waitlist,feedbacks --ide vscode
```
