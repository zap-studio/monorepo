# Migrating from React to Zap.ts

Zap.ts is built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which itself is a [React](https://www.react.dev/) framework. This means that migrating from a React project to Zap.ts involves adapting your code to fit within the Next.js ecosystem.

## Migration Steps

1. **Convert to Next.js:**
	- Move your routes and pages into Next.js's file-based routing system under `src/app/`. Whether you used [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), or another routing library, the migration should be straightforward.
	- Update your imports and code to use Next.js conventions (e.g., `next/link`, `next/image`).
	- Follow the [React to Next.js migration guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/migrating/from-create-react-app).
	- Follow the [Next.js to Zap.ts migration guide](/docs/migration/migrate-from-nextjs).

2. **Test and Refine:**
	- Run `bun install` to install dependencies.
	- Test your app and ensure all routes, and features work as expected.
	- Refactor and take advantage of Zap.ts' plugin system.
