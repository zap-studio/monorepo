# Why Migrate?

Zap.ts offers a modern architecture with:
- Built-in plugin system for features like authentication, analytics, payments, and more
- First-class TypeScript and Bun support
- Opinionated project structure for scalable apps
- Out-of-the-box support for protected/public routes, global error handling, and advanced middleware

Migrating lets you leverage these features and build on a robust foundation for modern web apps.
