title: Overview
description: A starter kit for building local-first applications for desktop and mobile.
---

A production-ready template for building cross-platform desktop applications with a local-first architecture.

Your data stays on the user's device, always available offline, with native performance and a small bundle size.

Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tauri**, and **Rust**, Local.ts provides everything you need to ship a polished desktop app: persistent settings, system tray integration, notifications, database storage, and more.

<Callout type="info">
Since Local.ts relies heavily on Tauri, we highly recommend checking the [Tauri documentation](https://tauri.app/develop/) for deeper understanding of the platform and advanced customization options.

## Features

- **Local-first** — Your data stays on the device, always available offline
- **Cross-platform** — Build for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android
