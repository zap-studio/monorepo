description: Why Local.ts was created and the philosophy behind local-first desktop software.
---

Local.ts was created to solve a common problem: **building desktop apps with web technologies takes too long to set up right**.

## The Challenge

Starting a new desktop app project typically means:

- **Days of boilerplate** — Setting up Tauri with React, TypeScript, and Rust requires significant configuration
- **Endless decisions** — State management, theming, database layer, testing setup... each choice takes time
- **Missing patterns** — Most starters are "hello world" examples that don't show production patterns
- **Fragmented docs** — Piecing together tutorials for each technology in the stack

We wanted to skip straight to building features.

## The Rise of Homemade Tools

AI is fundamentally changing how software gets built. With coding assistants and AI-powered development tools, **creating custom applications is now accessible to everyone** — not just professional developers.

This shift will lead to a rise in homemade tools:

| Trend | Implication |
|-------|-------------|
| **Lower barrier to entry** | More people building personal tools instead of relying on SaaS |
| **Data ownership** | Users want control over their data, not rental agreements |
| **Custom workflows** | Generic tools can't match purpose-built solutions |

When everyone can build their own tools, why trust your data to companies that might:
- Sell your information
- Get breached
- Shut down and lose your data
- Change pricing or terms

**Local-first software puts you back in control.**

### Own Your Data, Own Your Backups

With local-first apps:

- **Your data stays on your device** — No cloud servers to breach
- **You control backups** — Export, sync, or replicate however you want
- **No vendor lock-in** — SQLite files are portable and open
- **Works forever** — Apps don't disappear when companies do

Local.ts makes it easy to build these kinds of tools. Combined with AI assistants, you can create exactly the software you need — with the privacy guarantees you deserve.

## Why Local-First?

Local.ts embraces a local-first architecture where your app's data lives on the user's device:

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Privacy** | User data never leaves their machine unless they choose to sync |
| **Offline-ready** | Works without internet connection |
| **Performance** | No network latency — everything is instant |
| **No server costs** | Ship apps without backend infrastructure |
| **Reliability** | No dependencies on external services |

Local-first doesn't mean "never online." You can add sync, cloud backups, or API integrations when needed. But starting local-first gives you a solid foundation.

## Why This Stack?

Every technology in Local.ts was chosen for a reason:

### Tauri v2

- **Tiny binaries** — 10-20MB vs 150MB+ for Electron
- **Native performance** — Uses system webview, not bundled Chromium
- **Cross-platform** — macOS, Windows, and Linux from one codebase
- **Security-focused** — Rust backend with fine-grained permissions

### React + TypeScript

- **Familiar ecosystem** — Use the libraries you already know
- **Type safety** — Catch errors at compile time
- **Component model** — Build UIs from composable pieces
- **Huge community** — Answers for every question

### Rust Backend

- **Memory safety** — No null pointers, no data races
- **Performance** — Native speed for file operations, database queries
- **Reliability** — If it compiles, it usually works
- **Growing ecosystem** — Excellent libraries for desktop development

### SQLite + Diesel

- **Embedded database** — No server to install or manage
- **Battle-tested** — Powers billions of devices worldwide
- **Type-safe queries** — Diesel catches SQL errors at compile time
- **Migrations** — Version your schema with confidence

## What Local.ts Provides

This isn't a minimal starter. It's a production-ready foundation:

### Core Features
- **Settings system** — Persistent preferences with React integration
- **Theming** — Light, dark, and system themes with CSS variables
- **Database layer** — SQLite with migrations, models, services, and commands
- **Logging** — Structured logs to files and console

### Desktop Integration
- **System tray** — Background operation with menu actions
- **Notifications** — Native OS notifications
- **Autostart** — Launch at login option
- **Window state** — Remembers size and position

### Developer Experience
- **Turborepo** — Orchestrated builds across TypeScript and Rust
- **Ultracite** — Fast linting and formatting (oxlint + oxfmt)
- **Vitest** — Modern testing with coverage
- **Pre-commit hooks** — Automated quality checks

### Architecture
- **Layered design** — Clear separation between frontend, commands, services, and models
- **Type safety** — End-to-end types from Rust to React
- **Extensible patterns** — Add features following established conventions

## Who Is This For?

Local.ts is ideal for:

- **Web developers** who want to build desktop apps without learning a new paradigm
- **Teams** who need a consistent, well-documented starting point
- **Solo developers** who want to ship desktop apps quickly
- **AI-assisted builders** who want a solid foundation to extend with AI tools
- **Anyone** who values user privacy and data ownership
