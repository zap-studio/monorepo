# Migrating from Vite to Zap.ts

Zap.ts is built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), so migrating from [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) involves first adapting your project to Next.js.

## Migration Steps

1. **Convert to Next.js:**
	- Move your Vite routes and pages to Next.js's file-based routing in `src/app/`.
	- Update your imports and code to use Next.js conventions (e.g., `next/link`, `next/image`).
	- Replace Vite-specific config and plugins with Next.js equivalents.
	- Follow the [Vite to Next.js migration guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/migrating/from-vite).

2. **Test and Refine:**
	- Run `bun install` to install dependencies.
	- Test your app and ensure all routes, plugins, and features work as expected.
	- Refactor and take advantage of Zap.ts' plugin system.
