# Overview

Zap.ts includes a CLI tool that helps you manage your project with simple, powerful commands. The CLI is available via the `create-zap-app` npm package, which provides the aliases `zap` and `create-zap-app`.

When installed as a dev dependency, you can also run it using `npm run zap`.

## Installation

We recommend you to install the CLI globally for easier access, but you can also use it locally within your project.
