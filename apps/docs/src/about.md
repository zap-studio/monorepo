# About

## Our Mission

**We're on a mission to make developers 10x more productive.**

Millions of hours are wasted every year rebuilding the same infrastructure: auth, payments, emails, APIs. We're fixing that by creating the building blocks that let developers focus on what makes their product unique.

## What We Believe

- **Speed is a feature.** The faster you can ship, the faster you can learn.
- **Open source wins.** Transparency builds trust. Community drives innovation.
- **Developer experience matters.** Great tools should feel invisible.
- **Quality over quantity.** We'd rather ship one excellent tool than ten mediocre ones.

## What We're Building

### Zap.ts — Ship in Days, Not Months

[Zap.ts](./zap-ts/index.md) is our flagship product: a production-ready Next.js starter that handles all the boring stuff so you can focus on your product.

Teams using Zap.ts go from zero to deployed in under an hour.

### @zap-studio Packages — Modern Primitives

We're building a suite of composable packages under the `@zap-studio` scope:

| Package | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| [@zap-studio/fetch](./packages/fetch/index.md) | Type-safe HTTP client with runtime validation |
| [@zap-studio/permit](./packages/permit/index.md) | Type-safe centralized & secure authorization with zero config |
| @zap-studio/waitlist | Launch waitlists in minutes |
| @zap-studio/webhooks | Secure webhook handling with zero config |

## Our Approach

We build in public. Everything we ship is open source under permissive licenses. We believe the best developer tools are built by developers who use them every day.

## Get Involved

We're just getting started. Star us on [GitHub](https://github.com/zap-studio), try our tools, and let us know what you think.
