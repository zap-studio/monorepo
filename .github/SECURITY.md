# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of Zap.ts (CLI and template) is officially supported.  
I do not maintain or patch older versions. If you're using an outdated version, I strongly recommend upgrading to the latest release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Zap.ts (CLI, template, or documentation site), please **report it privately** to avoid potential abuse before a fix is available.

### How to report

- **Email**: alexandretrotel.freelance@gmail.com
- Please include:
  - A clear description of the vulnerability
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Impact assessment (if known)
  - A proposed fix (optional but appreciated)

I aim to acknowledge all reports. Critical issues may be prioritized.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- The `zap` CLI tool
- The Next.js template provided by the CLI
- The content and logic of the documentation hosted at [zap-ts.zapstudio.dev](https://zap-ts.zapstudio.dev/)

This policy does **not** apply to:
- Projects generated from Zap.ts (these become user projects)
- Third-party dependencies

## Additional Notes

- Contributions are welcome, but please avoid submitting vulnerabilities through public pull requests.
- I recommend auditing your generated Zap.ts projects periodically, especially before deploying to production.

Thank you for helping keep Zap.ts secure.
